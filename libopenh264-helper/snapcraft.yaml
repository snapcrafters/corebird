  Usage:

    2. prepend your command with "libopenh264-launch", like:
      commands: "libopenh264-launch foo" or in combination with
      a desktop-helper, like:
      commands: "desktop-launch libopenh264-launch foo" if foo is

    3. add needed plugs to your application:
      - for a graphical application:
          plugs: [X11 (or unity7 for appmenu integration)]. Thinki

          plugs: [pulseaudio]

          plugs: [home]

          plugs:
            mir:
            mir-libs:
              default-provider: mir-libs
